# PRODIGY_CS_01

- My first task in prodigy infotech

## About the Task

- Creating a python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allowing user to input a messsage and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

### Caesar Cipher Algorithm

> - it is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques.
> - It is also a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in a plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places in the alphabet. This shift value is known as the key.

> - This algorithm implemented by python programming language ,since the caesar cipher algorithm is used for encryption and decryption of text or message by shifting the given text letteror message with fixed number of postions defined by user as shift value.

### Features of the Task

1. Encryption:

   > - Each letter in the input text is shifted forward in the alphabet by the specified shift value (key).
   > - Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, numbers, punctuation) remain unchanged.
   > - The program preserves the case of letters (uppercase stays uppercase, and lowercase stays lowercase).

2. Decryption:
   > - The program reverses the encryption process to restore the original text or message.
   >   Uses the same shift value to "unshift" letters.
3. User Interaction:

   > - The program prompts the user to input a message and shift value.
   > - It allows the user to choose between encryption and decryption.

4. Python Implementation:

> - Simple and user-friendly implementation in Python.

### Usage Instructions

1.  Run the Python script.
2.  Follow the interactive menu:

    > - Choose encryption or decryption.
    > - Enter the message or text.
    > - Specify the shift value (key).

3.  View the encrypted or decrypted output.
